# Python Baseball-Reference.com Scraper

I added a BUNCH of extra searches from andewkittredge, but all initial credit goes to his fork :)

From him:

For a research project. Install beautiful soup (`pip install beautifulsoup`) and then invoke with `python baseball_reference.py`. 

Subject to break at any time for, literally, no reason.

Please don't sue me. Email me instead, I mean no harm.
